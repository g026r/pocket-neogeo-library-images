# pocket-neogeo-library-images
Neo Geo Pocket &amp; Pocket Color library images for the Analogue Pocket. Partially based off the images from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/), with quite a few corrections applied where their images were incorrect or necessitated expansion to allow for various regions.

Check the [releases link](https://github.com/g026r/pocket-neogeo-library-images/releases) for the latest zips.

To install: download the desired archive, unzip it, and put the resulting `ngp` directory in the `/System/Library/Images` directory on your sdcard.
